 * Job class for type=hadoopJava jobs.
 * <p>
 * According to the Azkaban documentation at http://azkaban.github.io/azkaban/docs/2.5/#job-types,
 * this is the job type you should if you need to have a Java job that needs to acquire a secure
 * token to talk to your Hadoop cluster. If your job does not need to securely talk to Hadoop, use
 * a javaprocess-type job instead.
 * <p>
 * In the DSL, a HadoopJavaJob can be specified with:
 * <pre>
 *   hadoopJavaJob('jobName') {
 *     uses 'com.linkedin.foo.HelloHadoopJavaJob'  // Required
 *     reads files: [
 *       'foo' : '/data/databases/foo'
 *     ]
 *     writes files: [
 *       'bazz' : '/user/bazz/foobar'
 *     ]
 *     set confProperties: [
 *       'mapred.property1' : 'value1',
 *       'mapred.property2' : 'value2'
 *     ]
 *     set properties: [
 *       'propertyName1' : 'propertyValue1'
 *     ]
 *     queue 'marathon'
