/**
 * A Workflow is a collection of jobs and properties that represent a logical workflow, i.e. jobs
 * with dependencies that form a DAG.
 * <p>
 * In the DSL, a workflow can be specified with:
 * <pre>
 *   workflow('workflowName') {
 *     // Declare jobs and properties
 *     ...
 *     // Declare the job targets for the workflow
 *     targets 'jobName1', 'jobName2'
 *   }
 * <p>
 * You can also declare workflows inside of workflows ("subflows") and declare them as targets and
 * dependencies:
 * <pre>
 *   workflow('workflow1') { ... }
 *
 *   workflow('workflow2') {
 *     job('job1') { ... }
 *
 *     // Create a subflow by cloning a workflow from another scope into this workflow
 *     addWorkflow('workflow1', 'subflow1') {
 *       flowDepends 'job1'       // Subflows can depend on jobs inside workflow2
 *     }
 *
 *     // Declare an inline subflow
 *     workflow('subflow2') {
 *       flowDepends 'subflow1'   // Subflows can depend on other subflows inside workflow2
 *     }
 *
 *     job('job2') {
 *       depends 'subflow1'       // Jobs can depend on subflows
 *     }
 *
 *     targets 'job2', 'subflow2' // Workflows can depend on subflows
 *   }
 * </pre>
