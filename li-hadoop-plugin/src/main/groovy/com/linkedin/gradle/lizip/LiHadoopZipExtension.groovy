  /**
   * Creates a zip archive that contains the .crt file and is setup correctly to work with CRT. CRT
   * has a couple of weird bugs. To be able to deploy from CRT, there must be:
   *
   * 1. An "artifact": line in the artifact-spec.json for this project. This is required by mint
   *    deploy and crt deploy.
   *
   * 2. An artifact in Artifactory with no classifier in the file name, i.e. the entry must be of
   *    the form: ${project.name}-${project.version}.zip.
   *
   * The Tools Python code explicitly tries to form this name as a part of the URL it downloads,
   * since it assumes you want to deploy the project artifact, rather than something with a
   * classifier in the name. Thus if you "artifact" line in the artifact-spec.json for your project
   * is ${project.name}-${project.version}-azkaban.zip, it won't work!
   *
   * To work around these problems, we'll give the CRT zip the special "defaultArtifact"
   * classifier. When the Tools Python code constructs the artifact-spec, it will explicitly use an
   * artifact with this classifier in the "artifact" line. This accomplishes #1 above. UPDATE: in
   * ligradle-core 2.x and above, there is an explicit mechanism for selecting the default artifact.
   * Once ligradle-core 1.x is permaently EOL'd, we can remove the previous mechanism.
   *
   * Then we'll explicitly set the archiveName property on the zip so that it has the right form.
   * This accomplishes #2 above. These two together produce the artifacts and an artifact-spec.json
   * that is compatible with CRT.
